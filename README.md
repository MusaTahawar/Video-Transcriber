# Whisper Transcription Script

This script uses the Whisper library to transcribe text and save the result to a file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this script, you need to install the Whisper library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install whisper
```

### Usage

1. Load the 'base' model from Whisper:
   ```python
   model = whisper.load_model("base")
   ```

2. Transcribe text (you should replace the empty string with your actual input):
   ```python
   transcription_result = model.transcribe("Your input text here")
   ```

3. Open a file in append mode and write the transcription result to it:
   ```python
   with open("transcription.txt", "a") as output_file:
       output_file.write(transcription_result['text'])
   ```

4. Run the script, and it will save the transcription result to the "transcription.txt" file.
